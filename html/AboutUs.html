                    At Hope Bridge, our mission is to provide immediate, effective, and sustainable support to the affected communities of the Haiti earthquake.
                     Our organization is committed to meet the unmet concerns and immediate needs of these communities that have arisen after a crisis such as this. 
                     Not only are we here to aid with the immediate emergency, but as well to offer long term recovery for those effected.
                      We understand the complexities that arise in disaster response. 
                    We are actively striving to be culturally sensitive and inclusive of the voices that are currently present within this disaster.           
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="paragraphs">
                    We have carefully budgeted care packages for the people in need and curated the necessary supplies which we
                     deem necessary and efficient that will aid the people in need over a prolonged period. 
                    Not only have we focused on basic survival needs, but also to aid in physical hygiene and mental wellbeing of the people affected by this crisis.
                     We will be delivering these packages efficiently with our 7-step plan to help those in need.
                 </p>

                 <p class="paragraphs">
                    We begin by asking for community members within our immediate vicinity to help aid us in delivering aid to those in need. 
                    We explain our process to them as thoroughly
                     as possible to ensure that they can be an entrusted spokesperson for our process. 
                    The spokespeople will be responsible of explaining our process to the crows to spread as much information as possible
                     to reassure the populus. We will then set up our distribution 
                    centers and carefully separate people to ensure that aid will be provided equally among the people.
                     Alongside that, help desks and supervisors will be stationed to deliver information and support. 
                    Finally, we conduct a thorough cleanup to restore order and provide long-term stability to the community, 
                    all while ensuring continuous support and recovery for those in need.
