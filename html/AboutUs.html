                    At Hope Bridge, our mission is to provide immediate, effective, and sustainable support to the 
                    affected communities of the Haiti earthquake. Our organization is committed to meet the unmet concerns 
                    and immediate needs of these communities that have arisen after a crisis such as this.
                    Not only are we here to aid with the immediate emergency, but as well to offer long term recovery for 
                    those effected. We greatly understand the complexities that arise in disaster response. We are 
                    actively striving to be culturally sensitive and inclusive of the voices that are currently present 
                    within this disaster.
