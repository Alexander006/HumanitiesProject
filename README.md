## Basic Web Development Instructions 

1. Clone your repo to an empty directory on your local machine
2. Open Visual Studio Code
3. Click on File/Open Folder
4. Open the directory/folder where your cloned the repo
5. Once open, you now have access to the code


## Git Pull, Commit and Push
As you guys code, it is very important to save your current progress/version on the cloud no matter what changes you make. To do so,
you must do the following.

1. Once you have coded a good version that you are going to improve on, whether the changes is small or big, click on the Source Control button
2. Provide a commit message indicating a very brief summary of what you implemented.
3. Click "Commit" and Push your current version to the repo and your code is there.

### Notes
- Commit good versions as often as possible so that if later you need to go back to what you did, you can refer to a previous commit you made.
- If ever you chose to work on another PC, make sure to Git Pull from the repo so that you have all the code you need.



## Git Branch
Since we're working on teams, it's not ideal to wait for someone to push their current version to master branch before you can push yours or
end up constantly pulling from master per recent commit to have the recent changes (which can lead to major conflicts). Git branch alleviates this issue and 
that's what we will be using.

1. On the repo page here, click "main"
2. Click "View All branches"
3. Create your branch (e.g Alex's branch)
4. Go on VS Code and fetch the repo on the Git Hub Settings
5. Find your branch
6. Checkout to your branch and work from there :)


## Git Merge
This is something we will be doing once it's time to integrate our versions to main. This has be done together (in person on call) as we don't want
to end up losing any components of the website that plays an important role in displaying what needs to be displayed, business logic etc.... 
The steps for making a pull request will be explained when the day comes.
