4. Open your terminal (CMD, Powershell, Bash (on MacOs))

## Git Pull, Commit and Push ⬇️🗒️⬆️
It is very important to save your current progress/version on the cloud no matter what changes you make. To do so,
you must do the following.

1. On the project, click on the Source Control button
2. Provide a commit message indicating a very brief summary of what you implemented.
3. Click "Commit" and Push your current version to the repo and your code is there.

### Notes🗒️ 
- Commit good versions as often as possible so that if later you need to go back to what you did, you can refer to a previous commit you made.
- Git Pull is useful if ever you work on 2 PCs or once you checked out to another branch locally. 



## Git Branch 🌿
Since we're working on teams, it's not ideal to wait for someone to push their current version to master branch before you can push yours or
end up constantly pulling from master per recent commit to have the recent changes (which can lead to major conflicts). Git branch alleviates this issue and 
that's what we will be using.

1. On the repo page here, click "main"
2. Click "View All branches"
3. Create your branch (e.g Alex's branch)
4. Go on VS Code and fetch the repo on the Git Hub Settings
5. Find your branch
6. Checkout to your branch and work from there :)


## Git Merge ↗️⬆️
This is something we will be doing once it's time to integrate our versions to main. This has be done together (in person on call) as we don't want
to end up losing any components of the website that plays an important role in displaying what needs to be displayed, business logic etc....
